# Machine Learning
Machine Learning, Building machine learning models using TensorFlow using deep learning CNN algorithm, optimize the model and preprocessing the image data by changing the base color of each image to RGB and resizing the image to 224 x 224 pixel. Using transfer learning from MobileNetV2 and tuning the model to help classify images.
## Machine Learning Implementation
1. Download dataset and unzip it
2. Split the dataset into training and testing
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Make a training and testing batch using train generator
5. Train 15 types of data in the Batik Betawi, Batik Cendrawasih, Batik Dayak, Batik Insang, Batik Lasem, Batik Megamendung, Batik Pala, Batik Parang, Batik Tambal, Kain Poleng, Ulos Bintang Maratur, Ulos Mangiring, Ulos Ragi Hidup, Ulos Ragi Hotang, Ulos Sadum
6. Improve the model with transfer learning with MobileNetV2
7. Save the model weight and .json
8. From the saved model, convert it into tensorflow lite
